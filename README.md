Go to bin directory then type the following command 
```
java Main ../ressources/AddressBook.txt
```
Or you can recompile the entire project by changing directory to src/main/ and then typing 
```
javac -d ../../bin AddressBook.java Main.java Person.java
```
You can also run JUnit tests with src/test/AddressBookTest.java
